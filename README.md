# Custom_GPT

This is a custom GPT model. data contain the custom text on which you want to train your GPT.

This can be changed as per the requirement.

Train the model for 5000 iterations.

For sparse attention, changed the tril/mask matrix to have only 3 lower diagonals.

code for that is:

```

tril = torch.tril(torch.ones(block_size, block_size))
index=0
for i in range(3, block_size):
    index=index+1
    for j in range(0, index):
        tril[i][j] = 0
self.register_buffer("tril", tril )

```

For decoding and predicting, we can give intial token numbers, GPT will itself predict the output.

Here below are some examples of output generated by GPT based on tha training data given.


**Output**: [PAD] image of a matchstick. as a casual user of chatgpt or another generative model, you may well have even less of an idea of what the initial training data consisted of. ask chatgpt where its data comes from, and it

**Output**: to is that they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. in speech recognition, the hidden markov model would output a sequence of n - dimensional real - valued vectors ( with n being a small integer, such as 10 ),

**Output**: systems to from driverless cars will be perceived by a human being interacting with an artificial entity that closely ( though imperfectly ) resembles another human. unsupervised learning : a branch of machine learning which, as the name suggests, blends elements of both

**Output**: performancesentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. free and open - source software feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. however, real

**Output**: essays included as thei could have only a slightly higher iq score than the average human being, or it could be vastly, unfathomably more intelligent, comparable to the difference in cognitive ability between an ant and nobel laureate roger penrose. association rule learning

**Output**: the of analysis of random phenomena. history a standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. a hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between

**Output**: conditions because a connection patterns embossed in their filters. therefore, on a scale of connectivity and complexity, cnns are on the lower extreme. architecture convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization

**Output**: on ai experts. musk never got back to us. if he really believed what he â€™ s saying, he should have. we should still be very worried if musk is wrong about when driverless cars are coming, naive about what it takes to build

**Output**: techniques statistical and complex optimization frameworks. the advancement of deep learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision. the accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed

**Output**: ##vis, 2010s raj reddy was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at stanford university in the late 1960s. previous systems required users to pause after each word. reddy's system issued spoken commands for playing chess. models, methods,
